    <h3>EARLY STATISTICS.&mdash;CHART, KENT.</h3>

    <p>Perhaps some one of your numerous readers will be good
    enough to inform me whether any <i>general statistical
    returns</i>, compiled from our early parish registers, have
    ever been published. An examination of the register of Chart
    next Sutton Valence, in Kent, which disclosed some very curious
    facts, has led me to make this inquiry. They seem to point to
    the inevitable conclusion that the disturbed state of England
    during the period of the Great Rebellion retarded the increase
    of population to an extent almost incredible&mdash;so as to
    suggest a doubt whether some special cause might not have
    operated in the parish in question which was not felt
    elsewhere. But, as I am quite unable to discover the existence
    of any such cause, I shall be glad to learn whether a similar
    result appears generally in other registers of the period above
    referred to.</p>

    <p>The register-book of Chart commences with the year 1558, and
    is continued regularly from that time. During the remainder of
    the sixteenth, and for about the first thirty-five years of the
    seventeenth century, the baptisms registered increase steadily
    in number: from that period there is a very marked decrease.
    For the twenty years commencing with 1600 and ending with 1619,
    the number 260; for the twenty years 1620 to 1639, the number
    is 246; and for the twenty years 1640 to 1659, the number is
    <i>only</i> 120.</p>

    <p>No doubt this diminution must be attributed partly to the
    spread of Nonconformity; but I believe that during the
    Protectorate, the registration of <i>births</i> was substituted
    for that of <i>baptisms</i>, and therefore the state of
    religious feeling which then prevailed bears less directly on
    the question. And even after the Restoration the register
    exhibits but a small increase in the number of baptisms. For
    the various periods of twenty years from that event up to 1760,
    the numbers range from 152 to 195. And pursuing the inquiry, I
    find that the number of marriages, for any given time, varies
    consistently with that of baptisms. If any of your reader can
    clear up the difficulty, I shall feel much obliged for any
    information which may tend to do so.</p>

    <p>Are the following extracts from the register above referred
    to of sufficient interest to merit your acceptance?</p>

    <p>"1648.&mdash;Richard, the son of George Juxon, gent., and
    Sarah, his wife, who was slayne 1&ordm; Junii at Maydestone
    Fight, was buryed on the third daye of June, anno
    predicto."</p>

    <p>"Joseph, the son of Thomas Daye, and An, his wife, who was
    wounded at Maydestone Fight 1&ordm; Junii, was buryed the
    eleventh daye of June."</p>

    <p>It is hardly necessary to mention, that the fight here
    referred to took place between the parliamentary forces under
    Fairfax, and a large body of Kentish gentlemen, who had risen,
    with their dependants, in the hope of rescuing the king from
    the hands of the army. After an obstinate engagement, in which
    the Kentish men fully maintained
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"
       id="page330"></a>{330}</span> their character for gallantry,
       they were defeated with great slaughter.</p>

    <p>"1653.&mdash;The third of March, Mr. John Case of Chart next
    Sutton Clarke, being chosen by the parishioners of the said
    Chart, to be the Register of the said parish according to the
    Act touching marriages, <i>births</i>, and buryalls, was this
    day sworne before me, and I do allow and approve of him to be
    Register accordingly. As witness my hand.</p>

    <p>"1660.&mdash;Marye, the daughter of John Smith, Esq. was
    baptized on the thirteenth daye of Januarie, 1660, by John
    Case, Vicar. The first that hath been baptized at the font
    since it was re-erected by the appoynm't of the said Mr. Smith,
    being full sixteene yeers paste. One Thomas Scoone, an elder,
    having, out of his blinde zeale, defaced and pulled it downe,
    w't other ornaments belonging to the churche."</p>

    <h3>BIS DAT QUI CIT&Ograve; DAT.</h3>

    <p>Inquiry has been often made as to the origin of this
    proverb. Alciatus is referred to generally as the authority
    whence it was derived. I think, however, it may be traced to
    Publius Syrus, who lived about forty-four years before Christ.
    It is equally probable, from the peculiar species of
    composition in which the thought, if not the exact words are
    found, that the proverb was derived from another and an earlier
    source. The object of mimic exhibitions is to impress the mind
    by imitation. Human life is burlesqued, personal defect
    heightened and ridiculed; character is never represented in
    degree, but in extremes. The dialogue of satirical comedy
    assumes naturally the form of the apophthegm&mdash;it is
    epigrammatic and compressed that it may be pungent and
    striking. Hence, no species of writing is more allied to or
    more likely to pass into household words, and to become
    proverbs among a people of quick retentive powers, such as the
    Greeks were, to whom we are perhaps indebted for this. I send
    you the extract from Alciatus; <i>Emblemata</i>, No. 162.
    Antverpi&aelig;, 18mo. 1584. Apud Christophorum Plantinum.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Tres Charites Veneri assistunt, dominamque
            sequuntur:</p>

            <p class="i2">Hincque voluptates, atque alimenta
            parant;</p>

            <p>L&aelig;titiam Euphrosyne, speciosum Aglaia
            nitorem;</p>

            <p class="i2">Suadela est Pithus, blandus et ore
            lepos.</p>

            <p>Cur nud&aelig;? mentis quoniam candore venustas</p>

            <p class="i2">Constat, et eximia simplicitate
            plucet.</p>

            <p>An quia nil referunt ingrati, atque arcula
            inanis</p>

            <p class="i2">Est Charitum? qui dat munera, nudus
            eget.</p>

            <p>Addita cur nuper pedibus talaria? <i>Bis dat</i></p>

            <p class="i2"><i>Qui cit&ograve; dat</i>&mdash;Minimi
            gratia tarda pret&icirc; est.</p>

            <p>Implicitis ulnis cur vertitur altera? gratus</p>

            <p class="i2">Fenerat: huic remanent una abeunte
            du&aelig;.</p>

            <p>Jupiter iis genitor, coeli de semine divas</p>

            <p class="i2">Omnibus acceptas edidit Eurynome."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Now here we have the proverb clearly enough.</p>

    <p>I subjoin the note upon the lines in which it appears.</p>

    <p>"Bis dat qui cito dat," in Mimis Publii. "Beneficium inopi
    bis dat, qui dat celeriter." Proverb, Bis dat, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Referring to the Sentences of Publius Syrus, published, with
    the additional Fables of Ph&aelig;drus, from the Vatican MSS.,
    by Angelo Mai, I found the line thus given:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Inopi beneficium bis dat, qui dat celeriter."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The same idea, I believe, occurs in Ovid. Query whether it
    is not a thought naturally presenting itself to the mind,
    reflected by memory, confirmed by experience, and which some
    Mimic author has made proverbial by his terse, gnomic form of
    expression.</p>

    <h3>ERRORS CORRECTED.</h3>

    <p><i>I.</i>&mdash;Sharon Turner's <i>Hist. of England</i>
    (Lond. 1814. 4to.), i. 332.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The Emperor (Henry VI.) determined to extort an
        immoderate ransom; but, to secure it, had him (Richard
        Coeur de Lion) conveyed to a castle <i>in the Tyrol</i>,
        from which escape was hopeless."&mdash;<i>Note</i> "104. In
        <i>Tiruali</i>. Oxened. MS."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Ibid. p. 333:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"He (Richard) was removed from the dungeon <i>in the
        Tyrol</i> to the emperor's residence at
        Haguenau."&mdash;<i>Note</i> "109. See <i>Richard's Letter
        to his Mother</i>. Hoveden, 726."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The fortress, here represented to be in the <i>Tyrol</i>, is
    about 220 miles distant ("as the crow flies") from the nearest
    point in that district, and is the Castle of Trifels, which
    still crowns the highest of three rocky eminences (Treyfels =
    <i>Three Rocks</i>), which rise from the mountain range of the
    Vosges, on the southern side of the town of Annweiler. In
    proceeding from Landau to Zweibr&uuml;cken (Deux-Ponts), the
    traveller may see it on his left. The keep is still in good
    preservation; and it was on account of the natural strength of
    its position that the imperial crown-jewels were formerly
    preserved in it.</p>

    <p>I am unable to refer at present to the MS. of Oxenedes
    (Cotton, Nero, D 2), which appears to give the erroneous
    reading of <i>Tirualli</i> for <i>Triualli</i> or
    <i>Trivalli</i>; but Mr. Turner might have avoided the mistake
    by comparing that MS. with the printed text of Hoveden, in
    which Richard is represented as dating his letter "de Castello
    de Triuellis, in quo detinebamur."</p>

    <p><i>II.</i>&mdash;Wright's <i>S. Patrick's Purgatory</i>
    (Lond. 1844. 8vo.), p. 135.:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"On the patent rolls in the Tower of London, under the
        year 1358, we have an instance of testimonials given by the
        king (Edward III.) on the same day, to two distinguished
        foreigners, one <i>a noble Hungarian</i>, the other a
        Lombard, Nicholas de Beccariis, of their having faithfully
        performed this pilgrimage."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In a note on this passage, Mr. Wright reprints one of the
    testimonials from Rymer (<i>Foedera</i>, vol. iii. pt. i. p.
    174.), in which is the following passage:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Nobilis vir <i>Malatesta Ungarus de Arminio</i>
            miles."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In the original deed, the text must have been <i>de
    Arimino</i> (of Rimini); for the person here referred to was a
    natural son of Malatesta de' Malatesti, Lord of Rimini and of
    Pesaro, and took the name of <i>L'Ungaro</i> in consequence of
    his having been knighted by Louis, King of Hungary, when the
    latter passed through the Malatesta territory, when he was
    going to Naples for the purpose of avenging his brother
    Andrew's death. In the Italian account of the family
    (Clementini, <i>Raccolto Istorico della Fondazione di
    Rimino</i>. Rimino, 1617-27. 2 vols. 4to.), L'Ungario is said
    have been a great traveller, <i>to have visited England</i>,
    and to have died in 1372, at the age of 45. (See also
    Sansovino, <i>Origine e Fatti delle Famiglie Illustri
    d'Italia</i>. Venetia, 1670. 4to. p. 356.)</p>

    <h3>DIRECT AND INDIRECT ETYMOLOGY.</h3>

    <p>I have just been exceedingly interested in reading a lecture
    on the <i>Origin and Progress of the English Language</i>,
    delivered at the Athen&aelig;um, Durham, before the Teachers'
    Society of the North of England, by W. Finley, Graduate of the
    University of France.</p>

    <p>The following passage well expresses a caution that should
    be always kept in mind by the literary arch&aelig;ologist:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"In the orthography of English words derived from the
        Latin, <i>one great and leading principle</i> must be kept
        in view. If the word is of new adoption, it is certain that
        its spelling will be like that which appears in the
        original word; or if it has come to us through the French,
        the spelling will be conformable to the word in that
        language; thus, persecution from <i>persequor</i>, pursue
        from <i>poursuivre</i>. Again, flourish from
        <i>fleurir</i>, efforescent, florid, &amp;c., from
        <i>floreo</i>. And to establish our orthography on certain
        grounds, it ought to be the business of the lexicographer
        to determine the date of the first appearance of an adopted
        word, and thus satisfactorily determine its spelling."
        (<i>Lecture</i>, p. 20. footnote.)</p>

    <h3>ERRORS IN POPE'S HOMER'S ODYSSEY.</h3>

    <p>In all the editions I have seen of this translation, the
    following very palpable errors exist, which I do not remember
    to have seen noticed. The first of these errors is contained in
    book ix. lines 325, 326, 463, and 533,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Seest thou these <i>lids</i> that now unfold in
            vain?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and consists in Mr. Pope having bestowed two organs of sight
    on the giant Polypheme.</p>

    <p>The second occurs in line 405 of the same book;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Brain'd on the rock: his <i>second</i> dire
            repast;"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and is owing to the inadvertency of the translator, who
    forgets what he had previously written in lines 342 to 348.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"He answer'd with his deed: his bloody hand</p>

            <p>The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore.</p>

            <p>Torn limb from limb, he spreads his horrid
            feast,</p>

            <p>And fierce devours it like a mountain beast."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And in lines 368 and 369;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The task thus finish'd of his morning hours,</p>

    <p>by which it distinctly appears that line 405 has a reference
    to the <i>third</i> "dire repast" of the Cyclops, instead of
    the <i>second</i>.</p>

    quantities, it is ascribed to Ovid:&mdash;</p>

    <h2>QUERIES.</h2>

    <h3>A TREATISE ON THE LORD'S SUPPER, BY ROBERT CROWLEY.</h3>

    <p>I have before me a somewhat scarce volume of Theological
    Tracts (small 8vo.), ranging between the years 1533 and 1614.
    With the exception of one relating to the Sacraments, by John
    Prime (Lond. 1582), the most curious treatise is that entitled
    "The Supper of the Lorde, after the true meanyng of the sixte
    of John, &amp;c.... wherunto is added, an Epystle to the
    reader, And incidentally in the exposition of the Supper is
    confuted the letter of master More against John Fryth." To a
    motto taken from 1 Cor. xi. is subjoined the following date,
    "Anno M.CCCCC.XXXIII., v. daye of Apryll," together with a
    printer's device (two hands pointing towards each other). This
    Tract was promptly answered by Sir Thomas More (A.D. 1533,
    "after he had geuen ouer the offyce of Lorde Chauncellour of
    Englande"), and is described by him as "the poysoned booke
    whych a <i>nameles</i> heretike hath named the Supper of the
    Lorde" (<i>Works</i>, pp. 1035, seqq., ed. Rastell). From the
    following passage of the reply, we learn that this offensive
    publication, like so many others of the same class, has been
    printed abroad:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"And in thys wyse is ther sent ouer to be prynted the
        booke that Frythe made last against the blessed sacrament
        answering to my letter, wherewyth I confuted the pestilent
        treatice that he hadde made agaynst it before. And the
        brethen looked for it nowe at thys Bartlemewe tide last
        passed, and yet looke euery day, except it be come all
        redy, and secretly runne among them. But in the meane
        whyle, <i>ther is come ouer a nother booke againste the
        blessed sacrament</i>, a booke of that sorte, that Frythe's
        booke the brethren maye nowe forbeare. For more blasphemous
        and more bedelem rype then thys booke is were that booke
        harde to be, whyche is yet madde enough, as men say that
        haue seen it" (p. 1036. G.).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>More was evidently at a loss to discover the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"
       id="page333"></a>{333}</span> author of this work; for,
       after conjecturing that it might have come from William
       Tyndal, or George Jaye (<i>alias</i> Joy), or "som yong
       unlearned fole," he determines "for lacke of hys other name
       to cal the writer mayster Masker," a sobriquet which is
       preserved throughout his confutation. At the same time, it
       is clear, from the language of the treatise, that its
       author, though anonymous, believed himself well known to his
       opponent:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I would have hereto put mi name, good reader, but I
        know wel that thou regardest not who writteth, but what is
        writen; thou estemest the worde of the verite, and not of
        the authour. And as for M. More, whom the verite most
        offendeth, and doth but mocke it out when he can not sole
        it, <i>he knoweth my name wel inough</i>" (sub fin).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But here rises a grave difficulty, which I have taken the
    liberty of propounding to the readers of "Notes and Queries."
    Notwithstanding the above statements, both of the writer and of
    Sir Thomas More, as to the <i>anonymous</i> character of the
    treatise we are considering, the "Epistle to the Reader" is in
    my copy subscribed "Robert Crowley," naturally inducing the
    belief that the whole emanated from him.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this difficulty may be resolved on the supposition
    that, while the body of the Tract was first published without
    the "Epistle to the Reader," and More's reply directed against
    it under this form, it might soon afterwards have reached a
    second edition, to which the name of the author was appended.
    It is certain that More's copy consisted of 32 leaves only (p.
    1039, G.), which corresponds with that now before me, excluding
    the "Epistle to the Reader." Still, it is difficult to conceive
    that the paragraph in which the author speaks of himself as
    anonymous should have remained uncancelled in a second edition
    after he had drawn off what More calls "his visour of
    dissimulacion." There is, indeed, another supposition which
    would account for the discrepancy in question, viz. that the
    epistle and a fresh title-page were prefixed to some copies of
    the original edition; but the pagination of the Tract seems to
    preclude this conjecture, for B.i. stands upon the third leaf
    from what must have been the commencement if we subtract the
    "Epistle to the Reader."</p>

    <p>Wood does not appear to have perceived either this
    difficulty, or a second which this treatise is calculated to
    excite. He places the <i>Supper of the Lorde</i> at the head of
    the numerous productions of <i>Robert Crowley</i>, as if its
    authorship was perfectly ascertained. But Crowley must have
    been a precocious polemic if he wrote a theological treatise,
    like that answered by More, at least a year previously to his
    entering the university. The date of his admission at Oxford
    was 1534; he was elected Fellow of Magdalene in 1542; he
    printed the first edition of <i>Piers Plowman</i> in 1550; and
    was still Parson of St. Giles's, near Cripplegate, in 1588,
    <i>i.e.</i> fifty-five years after the publication of the Tract
    we are considering. (See <i>Heylin's Hist. of the
    Reformation</i>, ii. 186., E.H.S. ed.) Were there <i>two</i>
    writers named <i>Robert Crowley?</i> or was <i>the</i> Crowley
    a pupil or prot&eacute;g&eacute; of some early reformer, who
    caused his name to be affixed to a treatise for which he is not
    wholly responsible? I leave these queries for the elucidation
    of your bibliographical contributors.</p>

    <p>If I have not already exceeded the limits allowable for such
    communications, I would also ask your readers to explain the
    allusion in the following passage from Crowley's tract:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"And know right well, that the more they steare thys
        sacramente the broder shal theyr lyes be spreade, the more
        shall theyr falsehoode appeare, and the more gloriously
        shall the truthe triumph: as it is to se thys daye by longe
        contencion in thys same and other like articles, which the
        papists have so long abused, and howe more his lyes utter
        the truthe every day more and more. For had he not come
        begynge for the clergy from purgatory, wyth his
        'supplicacion of soules,' and Rastal and Rochester had they
        not so wyselye played theyr partes, purgatory paradventure
        had served them yet another yere; neyther had it so sone
        haue bene quenched, nor the poor soule and proctoure there
        ben <i>wyth his bloudye byshoppe christen catte so farre
        coniured into his owne Utopia with a sachel about his necke
        to gather for the proud prystes in Synagoga
        papistica</i>."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Rastell here mentioned was doubtless he whom More
    (<i>Works</i>, p. 355.) calls his "brother" (<i>i.e.</i> his
    sister's husband), joining him with Rochester (<i>i.e.</i> Bp.
    Fisher), as in this passage, on account of his great zeal in
    checking the progress of the earlier Reformation; but what is
    the allusion in the phrase "with his bloudye bishoppe christen
    catte," &amp;c., I am unable to divine. Neither in the
    <i>Supplicacion of Soules</i>, nor in the reply to the "nameles
    heretike," have I discovered the slightest clue to its
    meaning.</p>

    <h3>WHAT IS A CHAPEL?</h3>

    <p>What is the most approved derivation of the word
    Chapel?&mdash;<i>Capella</i>, from the goat-skin covering of
    what was at first a movable tabernacle? <i>capa</i>, a cape
    worn by <i>capellanus</i>, the chaplain? <i>capsa</i>, a chest
    for sacred relics? <i>kaba Eli</i> (Heb.), the house of God? or
    what other and better etymon?</p>

    <p>Is it not invariably the purpose of a Chapel to supply the
    absence or incommodiousness of the parish church?</p>

    <p>At what period of ecclesiastical history was the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page334"
       id="page334"></a>{334}</span> word Chapel first introduced?
       If there be any truth in the legend that St. Martin's hat
       was carried before the kings of France in their expeditions,
       and that the pavilion in which it was lodged originated the
       term, it is probably a very old word, as the Saint is stated
       to have died A.D. 397. Yet the word in not acknowledged by
       Bingham.</p>

    <p>Is Chapel a <i>legal</i> description of the houses of
    religious meeting, which are used by those who dissent from the
    Church of England?</p>

    <p>Was the adoption of the word Chapel by dissenters, or their
    submission to it, indicative of an idea of assistance, rather
    than of rivalry or opposition, to the Church?</p>

    <p>Any answer to these inquiries, which are proposed only for
    the sake of information, by one whose means of reference and
    investigation are limited, will be very acceptable.</p>

    <h3>WHO TRANSLATED THE "TURKISH SPY?"</h3>

    <p>Is it known who really translated that clever work,
    <i>Letters writ by a Turkish Spy</i>? The work was originally
    written in Italian, by John Paul Marana, a Genoese; but the
    English translation has been attributed to several
    individuals.</p>

    <p>Among Dr. Charlett's correspondence, preserved in the
    Bodleian Library, is a letter inquiring after a Mr. Bradshaw.
    The writer says, "he was servitor or amanuensis to Dr.
    Allesbree, and proved very considerable afterwards, being the
    author of all the volumes of the 'Turkish Spy' but one; and
    that was the first, which, you remember, was printed a
    considerable time before the rest, and not much taken notice of
    till the second volume came out. The first volume was
    originally wrote in Italian, translated into French, and made
    English; and all the rest after carried on by this Bradshaw, as
    I am undoubtedly informed: so that I think him well worth
    inquiring after while in Oxford. Dr. Midgely had only the name
    and conveyance to the press, beside what books he helped
    Bradshaw to, which, by his poverty, he could not procure
    himself." In the margin of this letter Ballard has added, "Sir
    Roger Manley, author of the 'Turkish Spy.'" Baker, of St.
    John's College, Cambridge, has written on the cover of the
    first volume of his copy of <i>Athen&aelig; Oxoniensis</i>
    (bequeathed to the Public Library at Cambridge), "'Turkish
    Spy,' begun by Mr. Manley, continued by Dr. Midgely with the
    assistance of others."</p>

    <h3>PHILALETHES CESTRIENSIS&mdash;STEPHENS' SERMONS.</h3>

    <p>I shall feel much obliged if any of your correspondents can
    inform me what is the real name of the author of the following
    work:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"An Impartial enquiry into the true character of that
        Faith, which is required in the Gospel, as necessary to
        salvation; in which it is briefly shewn, upon how righteous
        terms unbelievers may become true Christians, &amp;c., by
        Philalethes Cestriensis. 8'o. Lond. 1746. Dedicated to
        Philip earl of Chesterfield, Lord-Lieutenant of
        Ireland."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In your 6th Number is an inquiry for a "tract or sermon" by
    the Rev. W. Stephens, which elicited a reply in No. 8. from
    "Mr. Denton," who mentions four sermons by that author and
    inquires whether any other sermons or tracts of his were
    published, which are not included in the two posthumous
    volumes?</p>

    <p>Now it has struck me that a volume of sermons in my
    possession may, from the nature of the subjects, be Stephens's,
    but whether included in the volume alluded to I know not. The
    volume contains six sermons, each with separate title and
    separate pagination. A common preface is prefixed, and there
    has been a common title-page, which unfortunately is missing in
    my copy.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Serm. I. The Divinity of Christ argued, from his right
        to worship, on Rev. v. 13, 14., preached in 1720, at Great
        Torrington, at the Visitation of the Archdeacon of
        Barnstaple."</p>

        <p>"II. The necessity of believing the Divinity of the Son
        of God, John iii. 16., preached at Great Torrington on
        Christmas Day, 1721."</p>

        <p>"III. The Humiliation and Exaltation of the Son of God
        considered in the new light, Philipp. ii. 6-12., preached
        at the primary Visitation of Stephen [Weston] Lord Bishop
        of Exon, at Great Torrington, 1726."</p>

        <p>"IV. Christ, King of the Jews both before and after his
        Incarnation, Matt. ii. 1, 2., preached on Christmas Day and
        First Sunday after Epiphany, 1727."</p>

        <p>"V. The Beginning, Extent, and Duration of Christ's
        Mediatorial Kingdom, same text, and preached at the same
        season."</p>

        <p>"VI. The natural supremacy of God the Son; same text,
        &amp;c."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The three last sermons have a title generally applicable,
    and repeated before each viz., "The Supreme Dominion of God the
    Son, both Natural, Oeconomical, and Judaical, proved from
    Scripture, in three Sermons." The separate titles bear date
    1729; and the publisher was Samuel Birt, at the Bible and Ball,
    Ave Maria Lane.</p>

    <p>This notice may supply the information of which Mr. Denton
    is in quest, and at all events I should be very glad to learn
    who the author really was. His sermons are, as is said of those
    of Stephens, far above the ordinary run. The period at which
    they were delivered agrees with the dates of those at page 118.
    The author, in the general preface, says, that Sermon II. was
    not "suffer'd to see the light before it had pass'd through the
    hands of <i>Dr. Waterland</i>." Was not Stephens subsequently
    Vicar of St. Andrew's, Plymouth?</p>

    <h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

    <p><i>Smelling of the Lamp.</i>&mdash;Can you or one of your
    learned correspondents, tell me the origin or first user of the
    literary "smelling of the lamp?" I know that it is commonly
    attributed to Demosthenes? but if it is his, I want chapter and
    verse for it.</p>

    <p><i>Gourders of Rain.</i>&mdash;Will any of your
    correspondents be kind enough to suggest the etymology of the
    word "gourders" (= torrents)? It occurs in the following
    passage of <i>Harding against Jewel</i> (p. 189., Antv.
    1565):</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Let the <i>gourders</i> of raine come downe from you
        and all other heretikes, let the floudes of worldly rages
        thrust, let the windes of Sathan's temptations blowe their
        worst, this house shall not be overthrowen."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="author">C.H.</p>

    <p>St. Catherine's Hall, Cambridge.</p>

    <p>The <i>Temple or</i> a <i>Temple</i>.&mdash;I am happy to
    see that your correspondent, Mr. Thoms, is about to illustrate
    some of the obscurities of Chaucer. Perhaps he or some of your
    learned contributors may be able to remove a doubt that has
    arisen in my mind relative to the poet's well-known description
    of the Manciple in his Prologue to the <i>Canterbury
    Tales</i>.</p>

    <p>You are aware that the occupation of the Temple by students
    of the law in the reign of Edward III. has no other authority
    than tradition. Dugdale, Herbert, Pearce, and others who have
    written on the Inns of Court, adduce this passage from Chaucer
    in support of the assertion; and they all quote the first line
    thus:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"A manciple there was of <i>the</i> Temple."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In Tyrwhitt's edition of <i>Chaucer</i>, however, and in all
    other copies I have seen, the reading is</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"A gentil manciple was ther of <i>a</i> temple."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Now the difference between "the Temple" and "a temple" is
    not inconsiderable. I should feel obliged, therefore, by any
    explanation which will account for it. If Chaucer was, as he is
    sometimes pretended to be, a member of the Temple, it is
    somewhat extraordinary that he should have designated it so
    loosely. The words in the real passage would seem to have a
    more general signification, and not to be applied to any
    particular house of legal resort.</p>

    <p><i>Family of Steward or Stewart of Bristol</i>.&mdash;I have
    in my possession a drawing, probably of the time of James or
    Charles I., of the following arms. Azure a lion rampant or,
    with a crescent for difference, impaling argent a cross
    engrailed flory sable between four Cornish choughs
    proper&mdash;Crest, on a wreath of the colours a Saracen's head
    full-faced, couped at the shoulders proper, wreathed round the
    temples and tied or and azure.</p>

    <p>On removing the shield from the paper on which it was
    pasted, I found a spoiled sketch of the coat of Poulett, with
    the name Ambrose Moore written over it in a hand of about the
    reign of Charles I.: the object in passing the fresh shield
    over the spoiled coat appears to have been merely to make use
    of the mantling.</p>

    <p>I have also a locket of silver gilt containing a miniature
    of a gentleman apparently of the time of the Commonwealth,
    finely executed in oils upon copper; on the back are engraved
    the arms and crest above described without the impalement, the
    crescent bearing the addition of a label. The only information
    I have is, that the locket and the drawing belonged to a family
    of the name of Steward or Stewart, who were clothworkers at
    Bristol during the Commonwealth, and for some generations
    later; and they are now in the possession of their descendants.
    The first of whom I have any authentic record is Hercules
    Steward, who was admitted to the liberties of the city of
    Bristol in 1623.</p>

    <p>I cannot find that any family of Steward has borne the arms
    in question; and if any of your readers can throw a light on
    the matter, I shall feel greatly obliged to them.</p>

    lately been published by her son.</p>

    <p class="author">Nemo.</p>

    <p><i>Bernicia</i>.&mdash;Can any learned correspondent favour
    me with the name or title of any English nobleman who held
    authority in Wales, or the Borders, in 1370-80? The motive for
    this query is, that a poem of the time, by Trahaearn, a
    celebrated bard, contains the following passage:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Though fierce in his valour like Lleon, with a violent
        irresistible assault, he vaulted into battle, to plunder
        the King of <i>Bernicia</i>; yet the ravager of thrice
        seven dominions was a placid and liberal-handed chief, when
        he entertained the bards at his magnificent table."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is not supposed that the king here mentioned was any
    thing more than a powerful nobleman, whose possessions, or
    castle and lands, were situated in the north of England; in
    which division of the island the ancient Bernicia was placed.
    As there is no evidence as to the locality or limits of this
    ancient district, it is hoped that an answer to the above query
    will afford a satisfactory solution to an uncertainty that has
    long existed among Welsh antiquaries.</p>

    I never heard it satisfactorily answered. An antiquary once
    told me that it was so applied from the number of <i>Johns</i>

    <h2>REPLIES.</h2>

    <h3>LETTER ATTRIBUTED TO SIR ROBERT WALPOLE.</h3>

    <p>I feel very confident that I once read the letter attributed
    to Sir R. Walpole (No. 19. p. 304.) in some magazine, long
    before I had ever seen <i>Banks' Extinct and Dormant
    Peerage</i>. My impression is, also, that I never believed the
    document to be authentic; and that opinion is confirmed by a
    reference to the <i>Correspondence of Horace Walpole</i>, vol.
    i. ed. 1840, and to the journals of the day. I find from these
    authorities, that the first of the memorable divisions which
    drove Sir Robert from the helm, took place on the 21st Jan.
    1741-2, when Pulteney's motion for a secret committee was lost
    by three voices only. We are told that the speeches were very
    brilliant, and Sir R. Walpole particularly distinguished
    himself. He might have been tormented by his enemies, but not
    by the stone, (the excuse assigned in the letter for his
    inability to attend the king), for Horace left him at one
    o'clock in the morning, after the debate had terminated, "<i>at
    supper all alive and in spirits," and he even boasted that he
    was younger than his son</i>. The next struggle was on the 28th
    of Jan., on the Chippenham election, when the minister was
    defeated by one, and his friends advised him to resign; but it
    was not till after the 3rd of Feb., when the majority against
    him upon the renewal of the last question had increased to
    sixteen, that he intimated his intention to retire. These
    facts, coupled with the inferences drawn by your correspondent
    P.C.S.S. as to the suspicious style of the letter, and the
    imprudence of such a communication, go far to prove that it was
    a forgery: but the passage in <i>Walpole's Reminiscences</i>,
    vol. i. p. cviii. ed. 1840, with which I will now conclude my
    remarks, seems to set the question at rest:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Sir Robert, before he quitted the king, persuaded his
        Majesty to insist, as a preliminary to the change, that Mr.
        Pulteney should go into the House of Lords, his great
        credit lying in the other House: and <i>I remember my
        father's action when he returned from Court, and told me
        what he had done; 'I have turned the key of the closet upon
        him,' making that motion with his hand</i>."</p>

    <h3>PORTRAITS OF ULRICH OF HUTTEN.</h3>

    <p>It is pleasant to see that an answer to a query can
    sometimes do more than satisfy a doubt, by accidentally
    touching an accordant note which awakens a responsive feeling.
    I am much pleased that my scanty information was acceptable to
    "R.G."; and wish it was in my power to give him more certain
    information respecting the portraits of <i>Hutten</i>, who is
    one of my heroes, although I am no "hero-worshipper."</p>

    <p>The earliest woodcut portrait of him with which I am
    acquainted, is to be found in the very elegant volume
    containing the pieces relating to the murder of his cousin
    John, by Ulrich of Wirtemberg (the title too long for these
    pages), which, from the inscription at the end, appears to have
    been printed in the Castle of Stakelberg, in 1519. It is a half
    length, in a hat, under a kind of portico, with two shields at
    the upper corners: the inscription beneath is in white letters
    on a black ground. It occurs near the end of the volume; in
    which is another spirited woodcut, representing the murder.</p>

    <p>The other two cotemporary portraits occur in the
    "Expostulatio," before noticed. The largest of these, at the
    end of the volume, is in armour, crowned with laurel, and
    holding a sword, looking toward the left. This is but
    indifferently copied, or rather followed, in Tobias Stimmer's
    rare and elegant little volume, <i>Imagines Viror. Liter.
    Illust.</i>, published by Reusner and Jobinus, Argent. 1587,
    12mo.</p>

    <p>I have never seen a good modern representation of this
    remarkable man, who devoted the whole energies of his soul to
    the sacred cause of the truth and freedom, and the liberation
    of his country and mankind from the trammels of a corrupt and
    dissolute Church; and, be it remembered, that he and Reuchlin
    were precursors of Luther in the noble work, which entitles
    them to at least a share in our gratitude for the unspeakable

    <p>Ebernburg, the fortress of his friend, the noble and heroic
    Franz von Sickingen, Hutten called the <i>Bulwark of
    Righteousness</i>. I had long sought for a representation of
    Sickingen, and at length found a medal represented in the
    <i>Sylloge Numismatum Elegantiorum</i> of Luckius, fol. Argent,
    1620, bearing the date 1522.</p>

    <p>Hutten's life is full of romantic incident: it was one of
    toil and pain, for the most part; and he may well have compared
    his wanderings to those of Ulysses, as he seems to have done in
    the following verses, which accompany the portrait first above

    <h3>CHANGE OF NAME.</h3>

    <p>"B." inquires (No. 16. p. 246.) what is the use of the royal
    license for the change of a surname? He is referred to Mr.
    Markland's paper "On the Antiquity and Introduction of Surnames
    into England" (<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, xviii. p. 111.). Mr.
    Markland says,&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Sir Joseph Jekyll, when Master of the Rolls, in the
        year 1730, remarks&mdash;'I am satisfied the usage of
        passing Acts of Parliament for the taking upon one a
        surname is but modern; and that any one may take upon him
        what surname, and as many surnames, as he pleases, without
        an Act of Parliament.' The decree in the above case was
        reversed in the House of Lords."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Mr. Markland adds,&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"From the facts and deductions here stated, it would
        seem that the Master of the Rolls had good ground for
        making his decree. The law, as it stands, however, had
        grown out of the <i>practice</i>: and common prudence
        dictates, that the assumption of a new surname should now
        be accompanied by such an authority as may establish beyond
        all question the legality of the act."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It must also be remembered, that a testator often directs
    that a devisee shall procure the royal license or an Act of
    Parliament for the change of name, in order to entitle him to
    the testator's property. If this direction be neglected, could
    not the party next benefited sue for it on that ground, and
    with success?</p>

    <p class="author">S.D.D.</p>

    <p><i>Change of Name</i> (No. 16. p. 246.).&mdash;The doctrine,
    that a person may change his surname without any formality
    whatever, has long been "settled," and is by no means of so
    recent a date as your correspondent supposes, which will
    presently appear.</p>

    <p>In <i>Coke upon Littleton</i>, after some observations as to
    the change of Christian name at confirmation, it is
    stated&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"And this doth agree with our ancient books, where it is
        holden that a man may have divers names at divers times,
        but not divers Christian names." (Vol. ii. p. 218. ed.
        1818, by J.H. Thomas.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Reference is made to <i>Acc. 1 Com. Dig.</i> 19, 20.,
    "Abatement" (E. 18, 19.); <i>Bac. Abr.</i> "Misnomer," B.; Rex
    <i>v.</i> Billinghurst, 3 <i>Maul. &amp; S.</i> 254.: but these
    passages throw no additional light upon our immediate
    subject.</p>

    <p>Sir Joseph Jekyll, in the case of Barlow <i>v.</i> Bateman,
    in 1730, said,&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I am satisfied the usage of passing Acts of Parliament
        for the taking upon one a surname is but modern, and that
        any one may take upon him what surname, and as many
        surnames, as he pleases, without an Act of Parliament." (3
        Peere Williams, 65.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The decision of the Master of the Rolls in this case was
    afterwards overruled by the House of Lords; but on a point not
    affecting the accuracy of the observations I have quoted.</p>

    <p>Lord Eldon, in the case of Leigh <i>v.</i> Leigh, decided in
    1808, made the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"An Act of Parliament, giving a new name, does not take
        away the former name: a legacy given by that name might be
        taken. In most of the Acts of Parliament for this purpose
        there is a special proviso to prevent the loss of the
        former name. The King's licence is nothing more than
        permission to take the name, and does not give it. A name,
        therefore, taken in that way is by voluntary assumption."
        (15 Ves. Jun., p. 100.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This case decided that the assumption of a name by a person,
    by the King's license, would not entitle him to take under a
    limitation in a will "unto the first and nearest of my kindred,
    being male, and of my name and blood." The same rule would no
    doubt hold as to a change of name by Act of Parliament. (See
    Pyot <i>v.</i> Pyot, 1 <i>Ves. Sen.</i> 335.)</p>

    <p>These extracts from the highest authorities will
    sufficiently show of how little use is an Act of Parliament, or
    the royal license, for effecting a change of name; indeed, the
    chief, perhaps I might almost say the only, advantage of these
    costly forms, except, of course, where they are required by the
    express terms of a will, is the facility they afford in case it
    should become necessary to prove that John White was ten years
    ago John Brown.</p>

    <h3>QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 6.</h3>

    <p>There is no class of books which it more behoves future
    compilers of glossaries to consult, than those which treat of
    geography, navigation, military and naval economy, and the
    science of warfare both on shore and afloat. As far as the
    technical terms have been used by poets and dramatists, much
    valuable illustration may be found in the annotated editions of
    their works, but much more is required for general purposes,
    and I could point out some fifty volumes which would enable an
    industrious student, possessing a competent acquaintance with
    those subjects in their modern state, to produce a most useful
    supplement to our existing glossaries.</p>

    <p>With very small pretensions to the amount of information
    which &Sigma; ascribes to me, I will at once answer his query
    on the meaning of <i>grummett</i>.</p>

    <p>GRUMETE is pure Spanish. It also occurs as a Portuguese
    word. I shall transcribe the explanations of it as given by the
    best authorities on those languages:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"GRVMETE.&mdash;El muchacho que sirue en el nauio, y
        sube por el mastil, o arbol, y por la antena, y haze todo
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"
           id="page338"></a>{338}</span> lo demas que le mandan con
           gran presteza."&mdash;Sebastian de Couarruuias,
           1611.</p>

        <p>"GRUMETE.&mdash;El mozo que sirve en el nav&iacute;o
        para subir &aacute; la gavia y otros usos. <i>Tirunculus
        nauticus</i>."&mdash;La real academia Espa&ntilde;ola.</p>

        <p>"GRUMETE.&mdash;Grumete he o mo&ccedil;o que serve como
        de criado aos marinheiros, sobindo pellos mastros
        at&egrave; &agrave; gavea, etc."&mdash;Raphael Bluteau.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We have a statement of the rank and ratings of the officers
    and men of a ship of war in the <i>Sea grammar</i> of captain
    Smith, 1627. 4to. The word in question, as a <i>rating</i>, had
    then become obsolete. The duties of the seamen are thus
    described:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The <i>sailers</i> are the ancient men for hoising the
        sailes, getting the tacks aboord, haling the bowlings, and
        steering the ship.</p>

        <p>"The <i>younkers</i> are the young men called fore-mast
        men, to take in the top-sailes, or top and yard, for
        furling the sailes, or slinging the yards, bousing or
        trising, and take their turnes at helme."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Now, a comparison of the definitions of the Spanish and
    Portuguese <i>gromete</i>, and the English <i>younker</i>,
    leads me to infer that the latter term had been substituted for
    <i>grummett</i> or <i>gromet</i>, and that the duties of both
    classes were nearly the same.</p>

    <p>If the above information should seem less precise than might
    be expected, I must make my apology in the words which Edward
    Jorden addressed to captain Smith on the publication of his
    <i>Sea grammar</i>:</p>

    <h3>BEAVER HATS.</h3>

    <p>Permit me to suggest that, in asking a question, it is often
    desirable that the querist should state briefly the amount of
    information he already possesses on the subject. For instance,
    had Mr. "T.H. Turner," when inquiring after <i>beaver hats</i>
    (No. 7. p. 100.), stated, that he had met with the mention of
    them as early as the time of Hen. III., I, of course, should
    not have troubled you with a notice of them in the reign of
    Elizabeth. Indeed, I owe Mr. Turner an apology; for if I had
    reflected a moment upon the extensive antiquarian information
    of the querist, I should certainly have concluded that he must
    be well acquainted with the authorities I cited, which happened
    to be at my elbow at the time I read the query. Mr. B. Corney
    (No. 19. p. 307.) has supplied a beaver hat from Chaucer's
    <i>Canterbury Tales</i>; we meet with another in his
    <i>Testament of Creseide</i>, v. 386., "in a mantill and a
    beaver hat." We may therefore conclude that they were not
    unusual in Chaucer's time. I now think it very probable that
    beaver hats were introduced into this country as early as the
    Norman Conquest; for we find mention of them in Normandy at a
    still earlier period. In the "Chronicle of the Abbey of St.
    Wandrille" (edited by Acheri, in his <i>Spicilegium</i>), we
    find, amongst the gifts of the Abbot Ansegisus, who died A.D.
    833,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Cappas Romanas duas, unam videlicet ex rubeo cindato, et
        fimbriis viridibus in circuitu ornatam; alteram <i>ex cane
        Pontico</i>, quero vulgus <i>Bevurum</i> nuncupat,
        similiter fimbriis sui coloris decoratam in orbe."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I do not conceive this cap to have been made of the
    <i>skin</i> of a beaver, for the term would then most probably
    have been "ex <i>pelli</i> canis Pontici."</p>

    <p>This Chronicle contains several curious inventories of the
    gifts of many of the abbots; in which we may see the splendour
    of the vessels and vestments used at that period in religious
    services, as well as the style of reading then prevalent
    amongst the monks.</p>

    <p class="note">[There is a Query which arises out of this
    subject which none of our correspondents have yet touched
    upon&mdash;What was the original meaning of <i>Beaver</i>, as

    animal, or did it give the name to it?]</p>

    <h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

    <p><i>Anecdote of the Civil Wars</i>.&mdash;In looking through
    your "Notes and Queries," to which I heartily wish continued
    success, I find, in No. 6. p. 93, a question which appears to
    be as yet unanswered.</p>

    <p>The story to which your questioner alludes as an "anecdote
    of the Civil Wars," is a very beautiful one, and deserves
    authentication.</p>

    <p>I have a note of it from Dr. Thomas's additions to Dugdale's
    <i>Warwickshire</i>, which dates the occurrence as having taken
    place Oct. 22, 1642, the day previous to the battle of
    Edgehill, and identifies the merry sportsman as Richard
    Schuckburgh, of Upper Shuckburgh; who, however, on his
    presentation to the king, "immediately went home, aroused his
    tenants, and the next day attended the army to the field, where
    he was knighted, and was present at the battle." Being out of
    the reach of books, I am unable further to verify the story;
    but it is to such unhappy rustics that your publication is most
    acceptable.</p>

    <p class="author">C.W.B.</p>

    <p class="note">[Thanks to the kindness of our correspondent
    "C.W.B.," we have referred to Dugdale's <i>Warwickshire</i>
    (ed. Thomas, 1730). vol. i. p. 309., and extract from it the
    following proof that Walpole had authority for his story. Who
    knows, after this, but we may in the same way trace from whence
    he procured the celebrated letter of the Countess of Pembroke,
    respecting which there is a query from Mr. Peter Cunningham, in
    No. 2. p. 28.</p>

    <p class="note">"As king Charles the First marched to Edgcot,
    near Banbury, on 22nd Oct., 1642, he saw him hunting in the
    fields not far from Shuckborough, with a very good pack of
    hounds, upon which it is reported, that he fetched a deep sigh
    and asked who that gentleman was that hunted so merrily that
    morning, when he was going to fight for his crown and dignity.
    And being told <span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"
       id="page339"></a>{339}</span> that it was this Richard
       Shuckburgh, he was ordered to be called to him, and was by
       him very graciously received. Upon which he went immediately
       home, armed all his tenants, and the next day attended on
       him in the field, where he was knighted, and was present at
       the battle of Edghill."]</p>

    <p><i>Mousetrap Dante</i> (No. 10. pp. 154, 155.).&mdash;I beg

    pp. 264, 265., where he will find a list (correct so far as it
    goes) of the fifteen MSS. of the <i>Comedia</i>, purchased for
    the Bodleian Library about the year 1822, from the Abbate
    Matteo Canonici, of Venice.</p>

    <p>I have reason for believing, that the only MSS. which exist
    in that collection, in addition to those enumerated in the
    list, are: 1. Canon Ital. 100. "Compendium Cujusdam
    Commentarii" (4to paper); and 2. "Codices Canonici Miscellanei

    seignory of Gower is the peninsula which runs out between the
    bays of Swansea and Carmarthen; and which terminates at Swansea
    on the S.E. side, and at Longhor on the N.W., and comprises the
    district which, in common with a part of Scotland, anciently
    bore the name of Rheged. It is a locality rich in all that can
    attract the antiquary and the naturalist.</p>

    <p>Mr. Dillwyn's <i>Contributions towards a History of
    Swansea</i> contains the following references to the Gower
    property of Cromwell:&mdash;"We are informed by the Minute-book
    of the Common Hall" (at Swansea), "that on May 19, 1648, there
    came to this towne the truly Honourable Oliver Cromwell,
    Esq.... Lord of this towne, the Seignory of Gower, and Manor of
    Killay, with the members thereof," &amp;c. "On May 5. 1647,
    Parliament settled the estates of the Marquis of Worcester, in
    Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire, on Cromwell; and, by a
    subsequent order, the estate in Glamorganshire was added to
    this grant. The conveyance from Parliament to Cromwell is made,
    not only in the name of his Majesty, but has a portrait of
    Charles the First at its head."</p>

    may be found, with the music, in Chappell's <i>Collection of
    English Airs</i>. He cites it as being in <i>Pills to purge
    Melancholy, with Music</i>, 1719, and states that in the
    <i>Essex Champion, or famous History of Sir Billy of Billericay
    and his Squire Ricardo</i>, 1690, the song of "The Man of Kent"

    <p><i>Emerald</i> (No. 14. p. 217.).&mdash;Before we puzzle
    ourselves with the meaning of a thing, it is well to consider
    whether the authority <i>may</i> not be very loose and
    inaccurate. This <i>emerald cross</i>, even if it was made of
    emeralds, might have been in several pieces. But we are told
    generally, in Phillips's <i>Mineralogy</i>, that "the large
    emeralds spoken of by various writers, such as that in the
    Abbey of Richenau, of the weight of 28 lbs., and which formerly
    belonged to Charlemagne, are believed to be either green fluor,
    or prase. The most magnificent specimen of genuine emeralds was
    presented to the Church of Loretto by one of the Spanish kings.
    It consists of a mass of white quartz, thickly implanted with
    emeralds, more than an inch in diameter."</p>

    <p>The note to the above exemplifies what I have just said. It
    is called <i>emerald</i>, he says, because it is <i>green</i>,
    from the Greek. I might make a query of this; but it is clearly
    a mistake of some half-learned or ill-understood informant. The
    name has nothing to do with green. <i>Emerald</i>, in Italian
    <i>smeraldo</i>, is, I dare say, from the Greek
    <i>smaragdus</i>. It is derived, according to the Oxford
    <i>Lexicon</i>, from &mu;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&omega;, to shine,
    whence &mu;&alpha;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&rho;&upsilon;&gamma;&eta;.
    In looking for this, I find another Greek word, <i>smirix</i>,
    which is the origin of <i>emery</i>, having the same meaning.
    It is derived from &sigma;&mu;&alpha;&omega;, to rub, or make
    bright. I cannot help suspecting that the two radical verbs are
    connected.</p>

    <p><i>Ancient Motto&mdash;Barnacles</i>.&mdash;In reference to
    your querist in No. 6., respecting the motto which "some Pope
    or Emperor caused to be engraven in the centre of his table,"
    and the correspondent in No. 7. who replies to him by a
    quotation from Horace, I beg to observe that honest Thomas
    Fuller, in <i>The Holy State</i>, 275. ed. Lond. 1648, tells
    us, that St. Augustine "had this distich written on his
    table:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">

    <p>With respect to the Barnacle fowl, it may be an addendum,
    not uninteresting to your correspondent "W.B. MacCabe," to add
    to his extract from Giraldus another from Hector Boece,
    <i>History of Scotland</i>, "imprentit be Thomas Davidson,
    prenter to the Kyngis nobyll grace [James VI.]." He observes,
    that the opinion of some, that the "Claik geis growis on treis
    be the nebbis, is vane," and says he "maid na lytyll lauboure
    and deligence to serche the treuthe and virite yairof," having
    "salit throw the seis quhare thir Clakis ar bred," and assures
    us, that although they were produced in "mony syndry wayis,
    thay ar bred ay allanerly be nature of the seis." These fowls,
    he continues, are formed from worms which are found in wood
    that has been long immersed in salt water, and he avers that
    their transformation was "notably provyn in the zier of God
    1480 besyde the castell of Petslego, in the sycht of mony
    pepyll," by a tree which was cast ashore, in which the
    creatures were seen, partly formed, and some with head, feet,
    and wings; "bot thay had na faderis." Some years afterwards, a
    tree was thrown on the beach near Dundee, with the same
    appearances, and a ship broken up at Leith exhibited the same
    marvel; but he clinches the argument by a "notable example
    schawin afore our eyne. Maister Alexander Galloway Person, of
    Kynk&egrave;ll, was with us in thir Illis (the Hebrid&aelig;),
    and be adventure liftet up ane see tangle, hyng and full of
    mussil schellis," one of which he opened, "bot than he was mair
    astonist than afore, for he saw na fische in it bot ane perfit
    schapin foule. This clerk, knawin us richt desirous of sic
    uncouth thingis, came haistely, and opinit it iwith all
    circumstance afore rehersit." So far the venerable "Chanon of
    Aberdene." The West Highlanders still believe in the barnacle
    origin of this species of fowl.</p>

    <p><i>Burnet</i>.&mdash;In addition to the opinions expressed
    in favour of or opposed to Burnet's "History," (No. 3. p. 40.,
    and No. 8. p. 120.), I may also refer to Dr. King's
    <i>Anecdotes</i>; he says,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I knew Burnet; he was a furious party-man, and easily
        imposed on by any lying spirit of his own faction; but he

    <p>Dryden's chastisement of Burnet&mdash;"the noble
    Buzzard"&mdash;in his <i>Hind and Panther</i> must be familiar

    Bishop's censure of the immorality of Dryden's plays. Applied
    to Burnet's <i>Sketches of Characters</i>, Dryden says:</p>

    <p><i>Prince Madoc</i> (No. 4. p. 56.; No. 18. p.
    282.).&mdash;In the darkness superinduced by the absence of
    historical evidence on the Welsh settlement in America, I beg
    leave to offer a few remarks on some ethnological subjects
    involved in this question.</p>

    <p>In reference to the specimen of a Welsh-Indian Vocabulary in
    Catlin's <i>N.A. Indians</i>, which "Gomer" opposes to Prof.
    Elton's proposition on this subject (No. 15. p. 236.), were the
    instances of similarity to exhibit the influence of opinion, of
    government, or of commerce, on the language of the tribe, the
    origin of such words would be as indisputable as that of those
    introduced by the English into the various countries of the
    East where they have factories; <i>e.g.</i> governor, council,
    company. But these and numerous other traces of the Celtic
    language which have been found in Florida and Darien are not
    indicative of such impressions; most of them, from their
    universality, bespeak themselves to be primitive; and who can
    assure us that some may not have reached them before the
    twelfth century, through "Walsh or strangers," "a race mightier
    than they and wiser," by whom they may have been instructed in
    the arts which have excited so much astonishment?</p>

    <p>The glass beads, erroneously called Druid's beads, furnish
    Catlin with another proof of affiliation, which, however, is
    invalidated by the well-ascertained facts of
    glass-manufactories having, in remotest antiquity, existed in
    Egypt, and of glass beads having been dispersed by the
    Phoenicians among the nations which they visited. (See Tassie's
    <i>Gems</i>, introd.&mdash;Here, by the by, are mentioned
    celebrated emeralds, which have turned out to be only lumps of
    green glass!)</p>

    <p>Lhuyd relates that the cross was honoured in N. America
    before the arrival of the Spaniards, and Sir R. Manley
    (<i>Turk. Spy</i>, vol. viii.) states that they found
    crucifixes also. Unfortunately for this hypothesis, it has been
    shown, by G. Becanus (<i>Hierogl.</i>, see Index), Olaus
    Wormius (<i>De Danicis Monumentis</i>, see Index), M. Ficinus
    (<i>De Vita coelitus Propaganda</i>, l. iii. c. 18.), and
    Kircherus (<i>Prodromus Coptus</i>, p. 163.), that in various
    countries the cross was, before the Christian era, an object of
    veneration, and symbolled the genius of their religion. In the
    event of crucifixes having been found (for which, however, Sir
    R. Manley supplies no authority) we need not be surprised that
    the Christian topography was so far extended, since the
    Christianity of China, between the seventh and the thirteenth
    century, has been invincibly proved; and simultaneously,
    perhaps, the aborigines of America received the symbol,
    &Epsilon;&rho;&omega;&sigma; &mu;&omicron;&upsilon;
    &epsilon;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&omega;&tau;&alpha;&iota;,
    which is peculiar to the Christian religion.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, permit me to cite Southey <i>versus</i>
    Catlin:&mdash;"That country," says the author of <i>Madoc</i>
    "has now been fully explored; and wherever Madoc may have
    settled, it is now certain that no Welsh Indians are to be
    found upon any branches of the Missouri" (Preface, note written
    in 1815).</p>

    <p>Since I wrote the above, I have met with a work, by Mr.
    George Jones, entitled <i>The History of Ancient America
    anterior to the Time of Columbus</i>, vol. i.: "The Tyrian
    &AElig;ra." In the second, not yet published, he promises to
    give "The Introduction of Christianity into the Western
    Hemisphere by the Apostle St. Thomas."</p>

    <p><i>Mistake in Gibbon</i>.&mdash;Those of your readers, who
    are, like myself, occasional verifiers of references, will
    perhaps thank me for pointing out a false reference, that I
    have just discovered in one of Gibbon's notes:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Capitolinus gives us the particulars of these
        tumultuary votes, which were moved by one senator, and
        repeated, or rather chanted, by the whole
        body."&mdash;<i>Hist. August.</i> p. 52.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>See Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall</i>, chap. 4, note
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page342"
       id="page342"></a>{342}</span> under marginal lemma, "The
       memory of Commodus declared infamous."</p>

    <p>These "tumultuary votes" are recorded, <i>not</i> by
    Capitolinus, but by &AElig;lius Lampridius, in his <i>Life of
    Commodus</i>. Vide <i>Histori&aelig; August&aelig; Scriptores.
    &AElig;lii Lampridii Commodus Antoninus</i>, capita 18, 19.</p>

    <p>Capitolinus wrote the life of his <i>immediate</i>
    successor, Pertinax; hence perhaps the mistake, "Egregio in
    corpore n&aelig;vus!" Let those who wish to know what passion
    really is, read the tiger-like yells of the Roman senate in
    <i>Lampridius</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Jew's Harp</i>.&mdash;The late Mr. Douce always

    <i>Jaw's Harp</i>, and that the Jews had no special concern
    with either its invention or its use.</p>

    <p class="author">J.H.M.</p>

    <p><i>Havior</i>.&mdash;The word "havior" is probably of a
    hybrid character; partly of Anglo-Saxo, and partly of British
    origin. If so, the first syllable is obvious enough, "half"
    being generally pronounced as if the liquid were considered an
    evanescent quantity, "ha'f, heif, hav'," &amp;c., and "iwrch"
    is the British word for a roe-buck. Dropping the guttural
    termination, therefore, and writing "ior" instead of "iwrch,"
    we have the significant designation of the animal described by
    Lord Braybrooke, whose flesh, like that of the capon, may
    afford a convenient variety among the delicacies of the season,
    if well cooked according to the recondite mysteries of the
    gastronomic art.</p>

    <p>N.B. "Heifer" has already been explained as "heif-ker,
    half-cre," A.-S., "anner," Br.</p>

    <p><i>Haviour, Haver, Hyfr</i> (No. 15. p. 230, and No. 17. p.
    269.).&mdash;If I may throw out a question where I cannot give
    an explanation, I would ask, are we not approaching very near
    to the word "heifer" (from the Saxon) in these, but especially
    in the last of the above terms? They seem to me to be
    identical. The introduction of the sound of <i>y</i> between
    the sounds of <i>v</i> and <i>ur</i>, is not uncommon in the
    vernacular or corrupted pronunciation of many words; nay, it is
    sanctioned by general usage, in "behaviour" from "behave,"
    "Saviour" from "save," &amp;c. If the words are identical,
    still the history of the appropriation of the one to male
    animals of the class described, and of the other to females,
    must be curious and worth investigating. May not the
    <i>aver</i> and <i>averium</i>, like <i>irreplegibilia</i> and
    other barbarous law terms, be framed (rather than derived) from
    one of our English terms, as well as from the French
    <i>avoir</i>?</p>

    existence of America was at least suspected by the ancients. As
    I have not had an opportunity of consulting the authorities
    myself, I cannot tell how far they may affect the point in
    question; and I fear the references are not as accurate as
    might be wished, but I shall be truly glad if they prove at all

    among the Ryots of Guzerat:&mdash;</p>

        <p>"Camp, Kulpore, Jan. 30. 1850.</p>

        <p>"The natives use [for their tents] a sort of woollen
        stuff, about half an inch thick, called 'numbda.' * * * * *
        * By the bye, this word 'numbda' is said to be the origin
        of the word <i>nomade</i>, because the nomade tribes used
        the same material for their tents. When I was at school, I
        used to learn <i>nomde</i>, from

    than justice to its merits and interest. We dare not attempt to
    enumerate one tithe of the gems in Glass, Enamel, Metalwork,

    originator of the exhibition, must be highly gratified at the
    manner in which, thanks to the liberality of the owners, and
    the zeal and good taste of the committee, his idea has been
    carried out. If, too, at this time, when there is so much
    unemployed labour among us, this exhibition should have the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page343"
       id="page343"></a>{343}</span> effect of creating a demand
       for articles which can be produced by the hand and mind of a
       skilful workman only, and not by machinery, however costly
       and elaborate, an enormous benefit, beyond that originally

       that of supplying fresh fields for the labour and ingenuity

    are making for collecting subscriptions for that purpose, to be
    limited to five shillings each, that more may have the pleasure

    <p>THE HISTORY OF JUNIUS AND HIS WORKS, and a Review of the
    Controversy respecting Junius, with an Appendix, containing
    Portraits and Sketches, by Junius, selected from the Letters.
    By John Jaques.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"This is a very able book; well arranged in its plan,
        and complete in its matter. To those who are interested in
        the controversy, or even to any readers of Junius who wish
        for further information than the common editions furnish,
        we strongly recommend this volume. They will find it full,
        without being overcharged; and it possesses an advantage
        even over Woodfall's edicition, in only containing what is
        essential to the point, besides exhibiting much which does
        not appear in that elaborate publication. The 'History of
        Junius and his Works' is an essential companion to the
        'Letters of Junius.'"&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, March 4,

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
